How to run a carpool based on BTC-Lightning.

## Step 0: Setup your lntxbot LN wallet

Follow the instructions here: https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/how-to-stack-sats-with-lntxbot

## Step 1: Create Telegram Group with a Lightning entrance fee

1. Thanks to [LnTxBot](https://t.me/lntxbot), it is now possible to have everyone need to pay some sats to be able to continue on into a group. 
2. You can start this by adding lntxbot to the chat group and trying the command `/toggle_ticket_100` which will make set it at 100 satoshis.
3. The main advantage of this is to keep out people who do not have LN to begin with

## Step 2: Craigslist listing

Craigslist.org is [one of the oldest classifieds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craigslist) site. You can find "rideshare" listed under community tab. The link for rideshare. It allows for posting anonymously, by allowing the user to mask their email through the website. 

1. Post on the rideshare community on craigslist about your carpool group and how to join on telegram. For example, if you are based in LA, you can go to https://losangeles.craigslist.org/d/rideshare/search/rid and post there.
2. Include the instructions to setup a telegram-based lightning wallet with [LnTxBot](https://t.me/lntxbot).
3. Please indicate "[LnCarpool]" on the headline so that it could be distinguished from the regular fiat-based.
4. You can share what route you take going to your work and back. 
5. Remember to add much sats (satoshis) would you accept. It's best to keep the fee lower than the usual offers so that people would be enticed.

## Step 3: Rideshare!

1. Pick up the passenger
2. Talk about crypto while you enjoy the ridesharing.
3. If the person hasn't setup in Step 0, ask them to setup their wallet. You may offer to load it up if they do not have any way to get BTC.
4. Enjoy the ride!
5. Once you arrive at the destination, simply ask the passenger to reply to one of your messages with /tip <amount of satoshis>. You can also opt to do a lightning invoice if you have other lightning wallets.
