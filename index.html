<li>Thanks to <a href="https://t.me/lntxbot">LnTxBot</a>, it is now possible to have everyone need to pay some sats to be able to continue on into a group. </li>
<li>You can start this by adding lntxbot to the chat group and trying the command <code>/toggle_ticket_100</code> which will make set it at 100 satoshis.</li>
